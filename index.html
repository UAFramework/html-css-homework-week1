              <h2>WHAT IS REGATA RACE?</h2>
              <img src="..." alt="Yacht regata race picture" />
              <p>
                A regatta is a term used to describe either a boat race, or
                series of boat races. Although the term typically describes
                racing events of unpowered watercraft, some powerboat race
                series are also called regattas. Most commonly, a regatta is
                either a series of rowing, sailing or yacht racing. 
              </p>
              <p>Although regattas are typically amateur competitions, they are usually
                very highly organized, formally structured events, with complex
                rules precisely describing the schedule and procedures of the
                event. No experience is needed to participate in an amateur
                sailing race - an amateur team of 3-5 people rents a cruising
                yacht with a professional skipper. They are given a day or two
                to prepare and train, and then they are released to the
                distance. And here the route, in addition to the usual short
                distances, already includes offshore ones - on the high seas!
                Within the framework of such regattas, the practice of “one
                professional on board” is quite widespread - the crew consists
                of amateurs with one professional yachtsman. The presence of an
                experienced sailor is simply necessary here - the distances are
                quite difficult and require an appropriate level of training.
                However, this is the beauty of sailing - round-the-world and
                ocean regattas are also open to amateurs, and it is quite
                possible to feel like a real yachtsman.</p>

              <p>

                safe to go on a yacht vacation with young children or the
                elderly? Taking kids and elderly people along with you on a
                family yacht vacation depends on their health and soundness.</p>
                <p>Hence, it is of prime importance to consider their individual
                medical concerns or any specific sensitivities with regard to
                marine life thoroughly before deciding on who can come on a

                through all of the safety precautions and remind the kids as
                well, especially the rules mentioned below: No running aboard
                and no throwing things. Do not go towards the yacht’s front
                without any adults. Follow what the captain says, always. Always
                swim under supervision. Do not leave the boat without asking an
                adult. Set a schedule for adults to share the kids’
                responsibilities. Some yachts are also equipped with
                child-friendly features that are both safe and enjoyable such as
                indoor cinema or an empty room for playing. Yacht Toys and

              <p>
                Sailing is a natural team building activity. There are several
                different roles to perform when sailing or racing a yacht, and
                if crew members do not communicate efficiently and clearly with
                one another when performing these roles then the boat will
                simply not sail.</p>
                <p>While getting to grips with a new environment
                and tasks such as navigation, sail trimming and handling the
                yacht, crew members will naturally develop their ability in
                several areas which can be transferred to the work environment,
                including: Communicating in a busy, unfamiliar & complicated
                environment Decision making, especially under pressure
                Leadership Acting as a unit and coordinating performance Self
                confidence In addition to really targeting the transferable
                skills above, a main plus point for sailing is that it is highly
                participatory and inclusive - leaving no one on the sidelines.
                As opposed to a number of activities, for example rock climbing,
                paint balling, and physical boot camps, sailing allows those who
                are nervous or want to take a bit of a 'back seat' to be a part
                of the experience, with everyone participating to some degree.
                With such a diversity of key roles on a boat there generally is
                one to suit every personality type, with those who are nervous
                often choosing to act as 'ballast' or steer the boat at first
                and then as their confidence builds taking on other roles such
                as working the sails. All of the roles on a boat, big or small,
                are important and impact other areas.</p>
