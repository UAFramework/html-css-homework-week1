                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Kevin is a tall, two-eyed minion with sprout cut hair and is usually seen wearing his golf apparel.</p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Kevin loves to make fun of and tease people or Minions, shown when he made fun of Jerry and teased him for being a coward. He likes playing golf polo and cricket. Kevin has a sense of humor, shown when he thought it was hilarious to see Tom turn into a mutant purple minion, but then immediately showed a cautious side when he realized that he was next to be a victim. In the film Minions, he is the protagonist and leader of the trio in search of a new master. He truly cares about the well-being of the Minion tribe (which is dependent on them having a proper master).</p>

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Stuart is a one-eyed short Minion with combed hair.</p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Stuart is playful, friendly, intelligent and funny. He is skillful at video games like his friend Dave. He can also be the most sincere and innocent out of all the minions. He also seems to have a rebellious and obstreperous attitude. He is considered to be a slacker among the other Minions, preferring to chill out and play the ukulele than listen to the rules. Also, he was said to be always hungry in Minions, such as when he attempted to eat Kevin and Bob when he was thinking of them as bananas. He also has a high sense of romance such as when he was attracted to a yellow fire hydrant in New York, thinking that it was a female minion.</p>

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>Bob is a short and bald Minion with heterocromia. He often carries around a teddy bear that he owns called Tim, which is brown with yellow buttoned eyes.</p>

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Bob is a Minion who is more childish and immature than most of the other Minions. He is described as a "Little Brother" who finds love in anything and everything, including a rat (who he named Poochy) he found in a sewer in the Minions film. He also enjoys bedtime stories and playing with his favorite stuffed teddy bear, Tim. However, in the audition scene in Despicable Me 2 (having grown since the time of Minions), he became more plumper which made him look more like the short and plump Minions with spiky hair, just no hair. Is also shown more mature, albeit still playful, as well as more of a goofball like all the other Minions.</p>
