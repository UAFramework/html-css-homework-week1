            <h2>Books</h2>
            <p>As a child, I didn't really like to read. It seemed boring to me and I picked up books only when necessary for studying. But a few months before the exams, I took all the books of Ukrainian literature in the school curriculum from the library.</p>
            <p>The first few days of reading were not very successful, I seemed to force myself, but within a week I was already hooked and read every free minute of my time. This is how my book addiction was born.</p>
            <p>Now I often read, I try to spend at least half an hour a day on books. One of my favorite series of books was Atlas Shrugged. This is a fiction book series, but for me it has become part of the self-development genre.</p>
            <p>I watch interesting reviews and new books on the <a class="post-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/kseniakellerman" target="_blank">Ksenia Kellerman</a> channel.</p>

            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>I fell in love with basketball as a teenager. Played in the team for 5 years, took part in tournaments, both in the region and all-Ukrainian.</p>
            <p>But I gave priority to studies, so I had to say goodbye to the basketball team and a possible sports career. But that doesn't stop me from playing with my friends on the basketball courts.</p>
            <p>Every time the warm season comes, we meet and spend a few hours playing together.</p>
            <p>I don't watch full basketball games, but I subscribe to the <a class="post-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWJ2lWNubArHWmf3FIHbfcQ" target="_blank">NBA channel</a>, where I can sometimes watch highlights.</p>

            <h2>Travels</h2>
            <p>My greatest journey, which is still ongoing, is moving from my hometown to the capital of Ukraine - Kyiv. I've been living here for 6 years and I don't regret moving at all.</p>
            <p>I really like to travel in Ukraine, because it is very beautiful, diverse and fascinating. I have been to many corners of the country. Most of all, I like the Carpathians and western Ukraine in general.</p>
            <p>In addition to my country, I dream of visiting many others, for which I am trying to develop both professionally and personally in order to be able to travel.</p>
            <p>I really like the channel of Ukrainian bloggers <a class="post-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@uzolimanko" target="_blank">Uzol and Manko</a>. They travel the world and share their impressions and life hacks.</p>
