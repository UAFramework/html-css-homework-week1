            <p>As a child, I didn't really like to read. It seemed boring to me and I picked up books only when necessary for studying. But a few months before the exams, I took all the books of Ukrainian literature in the school curriculum from the library.</p>
            <p>The first few days of reading were not very successful, I seemed to force myself, but within a week I was already hooked and read every free minute of my time. This is how my book addiction was born.</p>
            <p>Now I often read, I try to spend at least half an hour a day on books. I like different genres: adventure, fantasy, horror and detective stories. One of my favorite series of books was Atlas Shrugged. She fascinates with characters who are devoted to their work and their perseverance. This is a fiction book series, but for me it has become part of the self-development genre.</p>
